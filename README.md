## 🎯 Project Overview
Developed for the **Early Learning Lab (UoA School of Psychology)**, this project digitalizes traditional cognitive research tasks into an engaging 2D game platform for early childhood studies.

As the **Project Manager and UI Designer**, I ensured the transition from physical observation to digital data collection was **reliable, ethical, and child-centric**, while meeting academic research requirements.

## 🏆 My Role: Project Manager & UI Designer
**Team 21 Lead**

I led the end-to-end delivery of the **Marble Track** and **Apple Catcher** modules, overseeing planning, execution, and quality assurance across the full SDLC within a **15-week Agile framework**.

Key responsibilities:
- Sprint planning and delivery coordination
- Stakeholder communication with psychology researchers
- UI/UX design and usability validation
- Documentation and final reporting

## 🎨 UI/UX Design Philosophy & Innovation
I defined the visual identity of the platform, balancing **academic rigor** with **child-friendly engagement**.

### 🌿 Jungle-Themed Engagement
- **Thematic Consistency:** Designed a vibrant *Jungle* theme to reduce child anxiety during assessments and improve task persistence.
- **UI Fundamentals:** Applied core UI principles including **Visual Hierarchy** (directing attention to the marble), **Consistency** (unified button styles), and **Accessibility** (high-contrast elements for young users).
- **Interactive Feedback:** Designed and implemented a **Randomized Firework Celebration System** on the results page. Using Phaser’s particle system, multi-colored fireworks are triggered as positive reinforcement to reward task completion.
